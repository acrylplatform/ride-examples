# For example you want to create an asset that can be traded only by those clients who have some special asset as a license
# So you can regulate who is able to trade your token or it may be usefull in games,
# sending this token can give the character an ability to trade or perform other skills
# or amount of this token can imitate the health points of the players, so you can "trade" only if you are alive:)
#
# In this script case you can buy or sell SmartAsset only if your USDT token balance is greater then 10
