# This token represents a ticket that can be traded at face value only.
#
# Token price is hard coded into the script, and exchange is allowed
# only at that price. Such a token can be useful for show or sport
# tickets to help combat ticketing fraud.
#
# Additional restriction: a ticket can be burnt only after the show is over.
