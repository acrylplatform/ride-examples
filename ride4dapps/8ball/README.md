dApp uses an innovative(not) method of pseudorandom answer generation to give you the best possible answer.
And it also ensures that same question should get a different answer.

### How to use

1. Prepare Invoke script TX with function name `tellme` and single argument: `question: string`
2. Broadcast your TX
3. Your question and answer should be written to dApp data state
4. Question key: `yourb58address_q`
5. Answer key: `yourb58address_a`
