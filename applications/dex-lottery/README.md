# Simple DEX Lottery

Simple lottery concept on DEX.
When player place order it will have some chance to be matched with "winning" buy order or with "losing" buy order.
"Losing" order is needed to prevent multiple plays with one token.
Smart asset script prevents player from placing an order with price more than 1 wavelet and amount more than 1.
Winning chance is determined with Matcher exchange TX proof bytes, that should prevent "gaming" lottery.
Probability of winning is about 121/256.
The Lottery is played with Acryl pair and "tickets" can be sold at any other pair.
